            <h2>Highschool</h2>
            <p>  My number 1 highschool I would like to go to is Millikan High School. I am most interested in this school because of the QUEST program and they also have very good sports. It seems to be a very well rounded school that I would have a good time going to because of academics, sports, and also the fact that a lot of my friends are going there or go there now. </p>

            <h2>College</h2>
            <p> I am still deciding what College I want to go to because there's one here on the West Coast but also one on the East Coast. The one on the West Coast is CalTech because I am very interested in Technology, and the other is MIT because it also has to do with technology.</p>
