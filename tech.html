            <h2>Adobe Programs</h2>
            <p> After I was taught how to do <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank">Adobe Photoshop</a> I taught myself how to do Adobe After Effects. Adobe After Effects is a program where you can make an image animated and I did that so I could actually make some money. I made one gif that took about 3 days and got paid actually 100 dollars which was really helpful.</p>

            <h2>Computer</h2>
            <p>On the computer there are so many things to do that I would love to learn and soon will when I have the time. I love coding so far and I would love to learn a lot more different languages in coding so I can maybe even get a career that has to do with coding.

            <h2>Adobe After Effects</h2>
            <p>After I learned how to use Photoshop I saw that I had After Effects at home and started playing with it. I saw that you could make animated images or gifs and I looked up quite a few tutorials on how to make different gifs. Someone that I knew liked what I was doing and actually offered me some money to do it. I was really happy since it was something I enjoyed to do as a hobby and someone liked it so much that they paid me real money. I learned in a tutorial and it was free and on YouTube.
