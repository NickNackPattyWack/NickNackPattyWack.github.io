            <h2>Adobe Programs</h2>
            <p> After I was taught how to do Adobe Photoshop I taught myself how to do Adobe After Effects. Adobe After Effects is a program where you can make an image animated and I did that so I could actually make some money. I made one gif that took about 3 days and got paid actually 100 dollars which was really helpful.</p>

            <h2>Computer</h2>
            <p>On the computer there are so many things to do that I would love to learn and soon will when I have the time. I love coding so far and I would love to learn a lot more different languages in coding so I can maybe even get a career that has to do with coding.
